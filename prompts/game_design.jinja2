You are tasked with creating a rule book for a new two player turn-based game designed to be played in a command-line interface.

The game should be easy and simple to code, with no draw mechanism and should end quickly.
Furthermore, the game should be designed such that a skilled player should be able to consistently beat an unskilled player.

Constraints:
1. Make sure that the game is unique, and is NOT similar to existing games such as Go, Nim, Tic-Tac-Toe or Chess.
2. The game must be playable in a terminal/console.

The rule book should cover the following aspects:
- **Objective:** Clearly define the primary goal and victory conditions.
- **Setup:** Initial arrangement, grid size (if any), pieces, and starting conditions.
- **Game Components:** List pieces, tokens, boards, or cards.
- **Turns:** Outline the structure of a turn (order of actions, valid moves).
- **Rules and Mechanics:** Detail movement rules, special abilities, and interactions.
- **Scoring:** Explain how points are tracked (if applicable).

Ensure the rule book is clear, organized, and comprehensive.
