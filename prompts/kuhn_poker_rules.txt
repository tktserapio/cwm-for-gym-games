Rules of Kuhn Poker

Setup:
- Two players: Player 0 and Player 1.
- Deck: 3 cards (Jack, Queen, King). Rank: K > Q > J.
- Pot: Each player antes 1 chip (Total Pot = 2).

Game Flow & Actions:
1. The game begins with the 'Chance' player.
2. Chance MUST execute two actions: 'deal: <card> to P0' and 'deal: <card> to P1'.
3. These deal actions MUST be recorded in the state history.
4. After dealing, Player 0 acts first.

Betting Phase:
- Available actions: 'check' or 'bet'.
- If P0 checks:
    - P1 can 'check' or 'bet'.
    - If P1 checks: Showdown immediately.
    - If P1 bets: P0 must 'fold' or 'call'.
- If P0 bets:
    - P1 must 'fold' or 'call'.

Bet Amounts:
- A 'bet' adds 1 chip to the pot.
- A 'call' matches the bet (adds 1 chip).

Showdown:
- If neither player folded, compare private cards.
- Higher rank wins the pot.
- Winner takes all chips in the pot.

Rewards:
- Rewards are the net change in chips for each player.
- Example: If P0 bets (cost 1), P1 calls (cost 1), pot is 4. P0 wins.
    - P0 invested 2 (1 ante + 1 bet), wins 4. Net: +2.
    - P1 invested 2, wins 0. Net: -2.

Information:
- Players can ONLY see their own card and the betting history.
- They CANNOT see the opponent's deal action in the history (it is hidden/private).
